# GCC
GCC is compiler infrastrure project used for several languages
# LLVM/CLANG
The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is a set of compiler and toolchain technologies,which can be used to develop a front end for any programming language and a back end for any instruction set architecture.
The Clang project provides a language front-end and tooling infrastructure for languages in the C language family

## Comparisions between gcc and llvm 

### Based on generating objective files:
#### gcc 
1)  read source code
2) preprocess the source file
3) Intermeriate representation
4) optimizing
5) generating assembly file
6) assembly file generates objective file
#### llvm
the compilation is based in integrate self implemented compilers at the backend
here it similar to gcc but the difference arise is 
* it omits the process of generating object files these are generated from IR

#### Intermediate representation:
* llvm IRâ€™s data structures manare so consie such that they occupy less memory during compilation and faster traversal.
* gcc IR is not so consise compared with llvm .
#### Difference in languages support of gcc and llvm(front ends)
* past traditional languages like Ada, Fortran, and Go(GNAT) which are supported by gcc and c(gcc),c++(g++),objective c
* these languages front ends are GNAT,GCC,G++ FOR GCC
* new emerging langues uses llvm like Swift, Rust, Julia, and Ruby(rubinius). Llvm also support c,c++(clang),ada ,fortan(flang) and go(llgo).
* Languages front ends are rubinius,clang,flang,llgo.
#### Differences based on architecture(backends)
* gcc supports more less popular  architecutes
* gcc supports Alpha,ARM,AVR,Blackfin,Epiphany (GCC 4.8) etc.

* llvm supports ARM, Qualcomm Hexagon, MIPS, Nvidia etc.

#### Differnces based on language extenction
* gcc supports more language extenctions com assembly feature like Template instalation ,bounded member functions,multiversional functions etc...

* llvm only supports some of them like Extened integer types, selectively disabling optimization,loop hit optimization,attributes for thread security check(using locks )
#### Difference based on  error messages:
* llvm is more sofisticated based on error messages
much more features on diagonizing

## OPTIONS SUPPORTED
### VARIOUS OPTIONS IN GCC COMPILER:
#### Basic options are:
-c
*	Compile or assmemble code but not link .
	Output is object file without linking f.o

-S
*	stoping after the stage of compilation not doing assemble.the code is assemble code. f.s

-E
*	Stoping after preprocessing stage

-o file
*	output file to be placed in given file
 

### optimization options:



#### CODE SIZE OPTIMIZATIONS:
    -Os
    -fno-unroll-loops
* For unrolling loops so that compile time would decrease

```
-finline-limit=n(gcc)
```
* finline makes the function just copied into the other so that function calling  will not happen .so execution time decreases

```
-fno-jump-tables
```
#### Performance and remaining  Optimization
    -fselective-scheduling2 -fsel-sched-pipelining
* pipeling

```
-fthread-jumps
```  
* thread jumping

-ftree-loop-linear  -ftree-loop-optimize -ftree-loop-vectorize
**Program Instrumentation options,Assembler Options like -Wa,Linker Options,Directry Options:,Directory Options,Developer Options**

#### Warning options like Wmising braces- warn if braces are missed
    -Wunused
    -Wuninitialized
    -Walloc-larger-than=n
    -warray-bounds=n

### OPTIMIZATION:
-O<level> flags turns on some of the optimization flags
 
-O0
*	no optimization

-O1
*	the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time

	
-O2
*	if no the space and speed tradoff are present  these optimization could be used this increses both compilation time and the performance of the generated code
	  -falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-loops  -falign-labels
etc

-O3
*	here it has all optimization flagsof -o2 and it adds
 -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops
etc

-Os
* Optimization of size .
Adds all -O2 flags expect tho dont increase size




# ***llvm options***:
### Basic options like:
	-E
		whsh runs the prepocessor stage
	-S
		runs preproccing and llvm generation and optimizations as well
	-c 
		all stemps of compilation plus assembling and generating .o file object file
### CODE SIZE OPTIMIZATIONS:
    -Os
    -Oz(llvm)
    -mllvm -inline-threshold=n(llvm)
#### Language selection options like
	-std=<language>
	-std=<library>
#### Target Selection Options
	-arch <architecture>
	-march=<cpu>
#### Code Generation Options:
	-O0
		-no optimizations
	-O1
	-O2
		-moderate optimization
	-O3
	-Os
		extra optimization on reducing code size

Findings in both clang and gcc:
* ARM IS USING armv5t architecture
* AARCH 64 IS USING armv8-a
* AARCH 64 IS  MORE OPTIMIZATION for some function inline and recursions IT TAKES LESS TIME .
*  Arm uses mov,sub were as Aarch 64 uses ldp
* COMPARED WITH ARM  as aarch 64 is 64 bit and arm is 32 bit aaarch 64 is more optimized in space
**AARCH 64 and X86_64 IS CODE IS MORE OPTIMIZED AS COMPARED WITH ARM based on number of bits**  
* On size text,data used
**AARCH64~=X86_64<ARM**
* ARM 64-bit is the densest code than ARM32 -bit code  AND slighly less than GCC
*  binaries for x86-64 tend to be often quite a bit larger
## OPTIMIZATIONS
#### Tail Optimization

```
//fact.c
int fact(int n,int a)
{
	if(n==1)
		return a;
	else
		return fact(n-1,n*a) ;
}

```


``Running ->gcc -O0 -S fact.c``

* fact.s is generated as a recurseive call in assemble file

``Running -> gcc -O3 -S fact.c``
* fact.s it created lot of tables without any recursion involved which 
optimized the recursion

**LLVM IS HAVE MORE OPTIMIZING POWER THAN GCC.**

*Clang and LLVM improve the performance more  in comparison to GCC*
*GCC has almost same performance advantage over Clang and LLVM for most programs at the O2 and O3 levels.*
## Example 3
### Vector creation add adding to vector
```
typedef struct vector {
    void **items;
    int capacity;
    int total;
} vector;
void vector_add(vector *v, void *item) {
    if (v->capacity == v->total)
        vector_resize(v, v->capacity * 2);
    v->items[v->total++] = item;

# Finding
* Clang and LLVM optimize the vectors at the O2 level, while GCC optimizes the vectors at the O3 level
